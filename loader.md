## Plan: Space-Themed Loader

### 1. 3D Spaceship Model

I will start by finding a suitable, free-to-use 3D model of a spaceship in `.glb` format. This model will be the centerpiece of our loader.

### 2. New `PageLoader.jsx` Component

A new component file will be created at `src/components/PageLoader.jsx`. This self-contained component will handle the entire loading animation, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

### 3. Building the Loader Component

Inside `PageLoader.jsx`, I will implement the following:

-   **Full-Screen Canvas:** A full-screen container with a dark, starry background will serve as the backdrop for our animation.
-   **3D Scene with `react-three/fiber`:** I will set up a 3D scene to render the spaceship and other elements.
-   **Spaceship Animation:** The spaceship model will be animated to create a "flying off" effect. This will be achieved by manipulating its position and scale over time using the `useFrame` hook from `react-three/fiber`.
-   **Starry Background:** To complete the space theme, I will use the `Stars` component from `@react-three/drei` to generate a dynamic starfield.
-   **Loading Indicator:** A simple "Loading..." text or a progress bar will be included to provide feedback to the user.

### 4. Integration with `App.jsx`

Finally, I will integrate the new loader into the main application component, `App.jsx`.

-   A `loading` state will be added to `App.jsx` to control the visibility of the loader.
-   The `PageLoader.jsx` component will be rendered conditionally based on the `loading` state.
-   I will use `React.Suspense` to show the loader while the main application components are being loaded, providing a seamless user experience.
